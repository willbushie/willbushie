I am a 23 y/o software engineer currently working in the web development space. I have been programming for 5 years and 2 year professionally. 

I seek to build clean and usuable code that follows standards and is easy for other developers to work on. Documentation and code organization are are the heart of what I strive for.

In my current day to day, I'm using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some SQL, and Docker, all while working with Drupal. 

In addition to work, I love to learn new things and work on personal projects. Recently, I've been investigating React, React Native, TypeScript, and Docker. Have a look at some of my recent projects.
