I am a 23 y/o software engineer currently working in web development. I have been programming for 5 years and 2 years professionally. 

I want to develop clean and usuable code that follows best practices and is easy for other developers to work on and contribute to. Documentation, code organization, and testing are that the heart of what I do. 

## 

On a day to day basis, I'm using PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, some JavaScript, and Docker, all while working with Drupal. 

I love to learn new things and work on personal projects. Recently, I've been investigating React, React Native, TypeScript, and Docker.
